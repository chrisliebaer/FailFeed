![Stading in Fire: Bad](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chrisliebaer/FailFeed/master/.github/assets/badge/badge_fire.svg)

FailFeed is a World of Warcraft addon that displays a "kill"-feed of the stuff your boosted monkey team mates are taking avoidable damage from.
Similar to [ElitismHelper](https://github.com/amki/ElitismHelper) but just for you without spaming the chat.
In fact most of the internal spell database is taken from ElitismHelper.

The display is especially useful for healers and tanks to understand if you are doing something wrong or if your team mates are just bad.
Sometimes it a mix of both, but you are an adult and can decide for yourself.

# Features
* Output is colored and formated to include spell icons, class color and current role
* Window is freely movable and direction and alignment of text can be customized
* No one knows you are using it

# Known Bugs / Wishlist
* Ideally the addon would use EliteHelper's spell database directly, but EliteHelper does not currently expose it's database
* Damage taken is calculated wrong but I could not find any documentation on how to accurately get the effective damage taken
